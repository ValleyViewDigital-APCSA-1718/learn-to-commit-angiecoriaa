Copy and paste your code from these exercises into this file.

* 1.1
public class Test
{
public static void main (String[] args)
{
System.out.println ("An Emergency Broadcast");
}
}

* 1.3
/**Angelica Coria
 * 8/16/17
 * 1.3 Program about myself 
 **/
 
 public class Program
 {
     public static void main (String[] args)
     {
         System.out.println ("My name is Angelica Coria");
         System.out.println ("MY birthday is October 4th");
         System.out.println ("My hobbies is watching tv, and playing video game");
         System.out.println ("My favorite book is night");
         System.out.println ("My favorite movie is Me Before You");

 }//End class program 



* 1.4
/**Angelica Coria

 * 1.4 Quote
 **/
 
 public class Quote
 {
     public static void main(String args[])
   {
       System.out.println ("\"Work for a cause,");
       System.out.println   (" not for applause") ;
       System.out.println (" live life to express not to impress\"");
       System.out.println (" -Source, Grace Lichtenstein");
 }//End main method 
 }//End public class quote



* 1.5
  /**Angelica Coria
 * 8/16/17
 * 1.5 Program about myself 
 **/
 
 public class Program
 {
     public static void main (String[] args)
     {
         System.out.println ("\"My name is \tAngie\" ");
         System.out.println ("MY birthday is \t10/04/2000");
         System.out.println ("My hobbies include \twatching friends,");
         System.out.println ("My favorite book is \t\'Night\' ");
         System.out.println ("My favorite movie is \t\"Me Before You\" ");
